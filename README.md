### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes the topics did help especially with just becoming more comfortable with JavaScript in general. However I will say I felt pretty unprepared for the dynamic updating of the html with the javascript but the instructor demo helped a lot.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
For sure I would add a lot more styling and give it all more personality and make everything look more cohesive. I also would have loved to implement the search feature as part of the stretch feature.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I feel that the adapting of the page to different screen sizes is really well. I also really like just the general layout of it all. the feature page at first didn't go at planned but then I was able to fix it up. Something I did notice others doing was the addition of an embed of spotify or just putting in an mp3 to be able to play something which I thought was really cool.
